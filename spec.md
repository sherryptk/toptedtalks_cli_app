Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:

 [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
 I've created a CLI class that allows the user to interact with the program, prompting them to enter which Ted talk they would like more info on. It responds to user error by asking the user to re-enter their choice, allows the user to choose to see the list again and loops until the user chooses to exit.
 [x] Pull data from an external source
 I've created a Scraper class that pulls info on each of the 25 most popular Ted Talks of all time from Ted's official website, including title, speaker, description and url.
 [x] Implement both list and detail views
 Once inside the program, the user is presented with a list of the top 25 Ted talks and are then given the
 opportunity to find out more details on each talk.
